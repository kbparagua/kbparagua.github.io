<div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s almost a year and a half since I started working. Since I started building the foundation of my career. Maybe it&rsquo;s too early, but I just learned a major lesson in life.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to brag too much about myself (F*ck it. This is my blog), but I can confidently say that I&rsquo;m a skilled programmer. During college, I programmed a Lexer Generator for our mini compiler project and my professor thought that I just downloaded it. I don&rsquo;t know if the University expects less from students or if what I did is really unbelievable. Once, I got 150/100 score because I taught one of my professor a nifty technique to convert a number string to an integer object. I also have a short debate with another professor about Polymorphism, and made him doubt his knowledge in the said topic. I got exempted from a quiz because I&rsquo;m the only one who answered a challenge question given by a professor &mdash; <em>&ldquo;What is the difference between functional programming and object-oriented programming? And why is there a need for OOP?&rdquo;</em>. I explained to the whole class about the heap and stack, what triggers stack overflow error, how OOP helps prevent stack overflow, how an object is instantiated and other sh*ts. <strong>I&rsquo;m not a cum laude or whatever, I just know my sh*ts</strong>. Well, those are some of the highlights of my pre-work life. Sorry I bragged too much. I didn&rsquo;t mean to.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong><em>&ldquo;You need to be exceptionally good to succeed.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p>My dad keeps telling me that. So after graduation I&rsquo;m confident that I will succeed because I feel that I&rsquo;m exceptionally good. I&rsquo;ll just keep doing my best and all the things will go right. But f*ck it! This is real life.</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla, do you know him? Chances are you don&rsquo;t have any idea who the f*ck is that guy. I can&rsquo;t blame the society for not recognizing this man. Because of the fact that he is a loser. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong please. Tesla is one of my inspirations in life. He is a great scientist. He is exceptionally good in his field. But sadly, <strong>he is a loser in the game of life</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Tesla: Man Out Of Time&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>Tesla&rsquo;s ideas are really out of this world that people believe that he is way ahead in time. I will not go deeper on this topic but you can just google his name and you will realize how important his contributions are to this modern world. But why is he not famous like Einstein and Edison? Is he really that great? Well, if you are questioning his intellect, I will give you a rabbit, wait until you fall in love with it, then I will put it in a blender, and I will forcefully let you drink that rabbit shake while watching you cry. <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla">Tesla is great, period</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know that he is considered the major contributor for the development of Alternating Current? As in, AC, the reason why your electric devices are running. Yes, because of Tesla you can watch TV documentaries on how Thomas Edison worked with Direct Current. I can say that Tesla is way more intelligent than our famous hero Edison. But in terms of success, Edison is too far ahead of Tesla. Why? Because <strong>Tesla is just a super geek</strong>. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to market his talent. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to handle competitors. He is not a good businessman. He is just a great scientist while Edison is a superb CEO.</p>

<p>Edison knows how to play the game. I mean he really is a f*cking good player! He publicly demonstrated electrocution of animals using Alternating Current, just to tell the public not to support Tesla&rsquo;s ideas. Edison is a brilliant and dirty businessman. That&rsquo;s why he succeeded. While Tesla ended up selling his patents. It is really an unfair life. Despite of Tesla&rsquo;s greatness he still didn&rsquo;t receive the recognition that he deserves. Just because he didn&rsquo;t play well on this cruel game of life.</p>

<p>Life is a game. Sometimes you really need to play dirty. A cruel world indeed. I thought everything will be okay because of my skills. I thought I can just write great codes and everyone will recognize me. I thought I can just create programs and people will magically have interest in me. I realized, talent is not enough. <strong>A great scientist is different from a great businessman. A skillful programmer is different from a good employee</strong>. I need to participate in this ridiculous game. I need to learn politics. I need to know how to sell myself. I need to learn to fight. This is life&hellip;</p>

<p>This post is really about me. Nikola Tesla is just a bait. I know no one will read this if this is titled <strong>&ldquo;Sadly, Karl Paragua Is A Loser&rdquo;</strong>. Who cares right?</p>

<p>Sorry. That&rsquo;s life. Sometimes you must play dirty to get what you want. Cruel world.</p>
