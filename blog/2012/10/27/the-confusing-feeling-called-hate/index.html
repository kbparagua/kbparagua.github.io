<div class="entry-content"><p><em>&ldquo;Everyday, I make sure that I find time to hate people. It&rsquo;s good. It makes me think more about mysteries of life. ohhhh. f</em>ck you!&rdquo;*</p>

<p>A few days ago, my alter ego made that bold tweet. I was confused by that statement, so me and my alter ego had a talk about that sudden brain fart. The conclusion was startling. Nah, enough with the alter ego conspiracy just to sound like this post is something psychological. I just tweeted that because I realized that there is no single day in my life that I haven&rsquo;t killed someone in my mind. Yet I feel so good about it. So I&rsquo;ve reflected.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;There is something wrong with the site&rdquo; &mdash;&ndash; How the f*ck will I know what&rsquo;s wrong?! Can you just tell me what&rsquo;s the error!?&ldquo;</strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>&ldquo;If you have nothing nice to say, don&rsquo;t say anything at all&rdquo;, the wise guys said.</p>

<p>Why? Because negative things will just hurt people? Because hating someone will not contribute to the betterment of the world? Maybe. One thing I learned from all these years is that positive things just make us feel flattered. They feel so good. But sometimes they make us feel complacent. They even go up all the way in your head. They said you&rsquo;re so good at programming, so you subconsciously stopped striving to be the best. They said you&rsquo;re beautiful, so you assumed that almost all boys like you. On the other hand, negative things screw your heart, your dignity, and your self-esteem. It hurts so bad, you can even feel it after a year or so. But then after all of that you became stronger. Everyday you have that overflowing motivation to prove your haters wrong. A friend of mine once told me that people are like springs.<strong> We are like those magnificent spiral things, we need to be pushed down before we can fly high.</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another interesting and sorta funny thing about hate. Hatred is one of the best foundations of strong friendship. Okay. I&rsquo;m not educated enough to make this stupid assumption. But this is just my observation. It seems that two people develop a strong and deep connection if they hate the same people or things. I think that liking both thing is too shallow to create a spark between two people. And loving both person will just result to unimaginable catastrophe, especially for girls. But hating both thing or person is way much different. Finding someone who hates what you hate is like finding a soul mate. Finally a person who also wants to kill that b*tch.</p>

<p>So I think Dora The Explorer needs to stop saying &ldquo;I like that too&rdquo; all the time! Rather she must ask us what part of the adventure we hate the most and then shout &ldquo;I F*cking hate that too!&rdquo;. That way, she&rsquo;ll have a stronger connection with the kids. If only Dora The Explorer&rsquo;s producer is Seth MacFarlane.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve questioned myself about this constant hate inside me. Am I really just short-tempered? Or there are just too many idiots around me? Or maybe, just another conspiracy, maybe I&rsquo;m a product of a secret twisted government project for creating humanoids to spread negativity nationwide. But my best guess is that my profession molded me to be like this. A short <a href="http://edu.mkrecny.com/thoughts/be-nice-to-programmers" target="_blank">article</a> gave me some ideas about my sick behavior:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Programmer:</strong> When I&rsquo;m not in vim I&rsquo;m in the bug-tracker, a list of negatives. A list of what&rsquo;s broken and needs to be fixed. A list of ways in which I fucked up.</p>

<p><strong>Friend:</strong> Dude, I think you&rsquo;re being a little dramatic. Plus isn&rsquo;t fixing bugs and striking them off that list incredibly satisfying?</p>

<p><strong>Programmer:</strong> Sure it is. There&rsquo;s so much about programming that is incredibly satisfying and empowering. But it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that, for me, programming builds an acutely negative mindset over time. I&rsquo;m always asking the question &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with this?&rdquo; Positive people are always focusing on &ldquo;what&rsquo;s good about this?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>So all programmers have a negative mindset? Do all programmers have this habit of hating?
I don&rsquo;t know, but 37Signals said in an article <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php">&ldquo;Start With No&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t be a yes-man
Make each feature work hard to be implemented. Make each feature prove itself and show that it&rsquo;s a survivor. It&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Fight Club.&rdquo; You should only consider features if they&rsquo;re willing to stand on the porch for three days waiting to be let in.</p></blockquote>

<p>Actually, they are not saying that they hate every feature at first. They just don&rsquo;t like them. The idea is like this: <strong>Hate everything at first and let them work hard to be liked</strong>. They are using negativity to choose the best features only. They are using hate to create good things.</p>

<p>I think there are real benefits from hating. What&rsquo;s the force behind Philippines&#8217; People Power Revolution? I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m sure those Filipinos hate Marcos. Why did Larry Page and Sergey Brin created Google? Maybe they hate those slow and inaccurate search engines.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this article with no clear idea what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;ve no real message in mind. F<em>ck me right? So what&rsquo;s the final verdict for this confusing feeling called hate? Hate is a negative feeling for sure. But we can&rsquo;t deny that it has a huge contribution to the betterment of the world. Love makes the world go round. But hate changes the world dramatically. I&rsquo;m not an evangelist of hate. I just think that hate is a misunderstood feeling. It&rsquo;s okay to hate, just be logical about it. Don&rsquo;t be like those hipsters who hate things because, uhm.. F</em>ck them! What&rsquo;s their reason?!</p>

<p>Everyday make sure you find time to hate. Just don&rsquo;t kill people, especially the clients.</p>
