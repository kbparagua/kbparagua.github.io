<div class="entry-content"><p>The time has come again to ask myself these disturbing questions:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;So how did you spent your life this year? Anything new? Anything changed? Where are you now?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I just celebrated either the 23rd year of my mere existence or 23rd year of me living my life. I&rsquo;m still not sure which of the two. Whatever. I&rsquo;ll find out next year. Hopefully. But one thing is for sure, this is the time to stand in front of the mirror and rediscover myself.</p>

<p><em>So, what did you discover looking at your past self? Any lessons for your future self?</em></p>

<p>Okay. I have some minor lessons like <em>Time is Gold</em> or <em>Take a bath everyday</em>, but I&rsquo;ll talk to you about that in another time. For now, here are the 4 major lessons I want you to keep in mind.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>1. Talent is Overrated.</strong></p>

<p>Congratulations! You will do great in school if you are good at something. But after school, well, it&rsquo;s a different playing grounds. We have unthinkable and unimaginable rules here. You can&rsquo;t survive here only with that talent you are bragging about. You will go down fast and early if you hold on to that belief that talent alone will put you on top. The world is a big strategy game. A game of power, deception, and sacrifice. Or in a more concise word, this is <strong>fucking politics</strong> my friend. This is how the world works, you cannot change it. There are only 2 choices: accept and join, or fight and lose.</p>

<p><a href="http://karlparagua.com/blog/2012/12/22/nikola-tesla-is-a-loser/">I&rsquo;ve got to say that I learned this the hard way</a>. After graduating, I spent 2 ore more years depressed and frustrated with myself. Until a friend of mine introduced me to a book called &ldquo;48 Laws of Power&rdquo;. It opened my mind to how this immoral world works. It is bad, yet good. Confusing indeed. Yes, love makes the world go round. But I believe it is specifically pertaining to people&rsquo;s undeniable love for power. It is hard to stomach how this fucking world works. But we have no choice. We can&rsquo;t beat the system. We can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><strong>2. Direct way is the easiest, but not always the best way.</strong></p>

<p>Honesty is the best policy. Yeah right. Now, tell your boss how much you hate him.</p>

<p>Before, I&rsquo;m a very frank person. I say what I want to say. If I hate you, I will shout it in front of your fucking face. Consequences of my actions are not in my mind. There&rsquo;s nothing in my mind but the overflowing emotion to say how much I want you to die.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. That&rsquo;s all in the past.</p>

<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said, the world is a big strategy game. You need to conceal your emotions if you are playing poker. You need to hide your intentions in chess. You will still pursue your goal, but do it indirectly and with style. Think of a clever way to express your emotion without damaging yourself. Attacking directly is the easiest way, but chances are you will be the in the disadvantaged position in the long run. Use your creativity and attack indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>3. Do something you&rsquo;ve never done to achieve something you never had.</strong></p>

<p>Recently, I had a fight with my girlfriend. It&rsquo;s that kind of fight in which I know that our whole relationship is hanging on the edge. One wrong move and everything will be over. I needed to do something to save our 6-year relationship. But my half-ass attempts to say sorry were not working. Fuck it! So I did what I needed to do. I did something I&rsquo;ve never done in my entire life. I searched for her office, went there early in the morning, gave her flowers, and said I&rsquo;m sorry. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s my ace. And thanks God, everything went fine. It&rsquo;s a difficult decision for me. I was all nervous and shit. But I needed to do that to achieve her trust again.</p>

<p><strong>It is called stupidity when you do something over and over again, and yet expecting the result to change</strong>. If you can&rsquo;t achieve something after trying countless of times, take a step back and think about that one thing you are afraid to do. Maybe that&rsquo;s the only solution. If you really want to achieve your goals, grow some balls and be willing to do something you haven&rsquo;t done before. Stop thinking about the what-ifs and other shits, just focus on your goal and just do what you need to do!</p>

<p><strong>4. Fear is illogical.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of the dark because of those fucking Asian horror movies. Those you-will-question-your-sexuality-after-this movies reveal the little girl inside me (Figuratively!). That&rsquo;s my biggest weakness, and I&rsquo;m not shy about that! However, I really want to destroy that fear inside me. Because I can&rsquo;t be a good father to my future children if I&rsquo;m afraid of the dark. Just think of a dad who can&rsquo;t protect his child against bedroom monsters.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another secret: I developed an OCD recently.</p>

<p>I will not talk further about the details, but it makes me overthink nonsense things and fear nonsense shits. It was terrible. It ruined my every day life. Until I read about the details of that shitty OCD. Then in that moment, I realized that it is all in the head. It&rsquo;s just my brain playing games with me. The fear is only an illusion. It seems real but if you just take your time to investigate it thoroughly, you will find out that it is just a fake. A beautifully manufactured fake created by your brain to appear super realistic to fool itself. Yes, your brain is fucking with itself.</p>

<p><strong>Your fear is not real</strong>. Think about it. Your mind is the problem, and it is also the solution.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Keep these in mind my friend. Good luck to the next year of your life.</p>
