<div class="entry-content"><p>Once again, I stare at the chessboard.
I can see colored wooden men standing on black and white squares.
Everything is clear, but nothing makes any sense.
Fuck. Here it is again. My heart is pounding so hard. My hands are shaking.
What is happening? My mind is full of shit.</p>

<p>With full of conviction, he moves his piece.</p>

<p>Just what the fuck is that?!
What should I do? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I don&rsquo;t know!</p>

<p>I move my piece somewhere. I have no idea. Then instantly, he responds.
As if he already knows what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Checkmate!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Ww&mdash;&ndash; what?!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Before the helpless me even grasps the brutality of the situation, the game ends.
In a snap of a finger, the shaking and pounding is gone.
The gears inside my head starts working again, and then, everything in front of me becomes vivid and obvious.
I see, the black king is helplessly cornered by a single ambitious pawn and of course his powerful racist queen.
What happened? I have no fucking idea. But I know something was wrong during that terrible battle.
It&rsquo;s like that I&rsquo;m not the one who played that game.
All I can recall is my first move, and after that, it seems like someone or something took over the driver&rsquo;s seat for me.
Fuck that.</p>

<p>Besides torturing my feeble brain through playing chess, I also collect callus through playing guitar.
I play Red Hot Chili Peppers songs almost exclusively.
The frenzy of funky hendirx-esque guitar licks that John Frusciante incorporates in each song are just addicting. Under the Bridge, Snow, Soul to Squeeze, Funky Monks, you name it.
And considering the sublimity of the techniques used in each song,
I absolutely need to practice them slowly until it sounds justifiable.
Applying muscle memory, motor learning, and other scientific buzzwords just to
rationalize my incompetence, I rigorously practice each note transitions up to the
point that my fingers can move without thinking anymore.
But I&rsquo;ve noticed that even how well I can play a song, everything fucks up every time I let my girlfriend listen to me.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I practiced this new funky song! It is cool. Listen.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>With sweaty palms, I hold my cheap black Epiphone Les Paul and assume the <em>i-will-fucking-rock-this-song</em> face. Then one by one, I let the guitar pick slap the strings as they create this alluring funky melody.</p>

<p>A couple of funky notes passed, then all of a sudden the familiar harmony faded.
An off-pitch note was hit. Fuck. A buzzing F chord came next. Fuck again.
My hands begins to shake as I wander across the fretboard looking for the next note.
Great! I forget what&rsquo;s next.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;What the fuck!? Wait. I can do this perfectly during practice! I swear!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Yeah. That pretty much sums up what happens every time I fucked up playing a Red Hot song.</p>

<p>I guess, you are getting the pattern here.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to tell that my nerves are kicking in during those fucked up moments. Heart is pounding too fast. Hands are shaking uncontrollably. Mind is going void. We know the symptoms very well. It is clear, I was nervous during those instances, and everyone said that it is certainly normal. But, the big question here is <strong>Why</strong>?</p>

<p>Why the hell am I nervous playing chess?!
A casual game with a friend, without any bets and all the trash-talking.</p>

<p>And please tell me why the fuck is my nerves acting up every time I play a guitar in front of my girlfriend?! My girlfriend of 8 years!</p>

<p>Tell me!</p>

<p><em>A short clip showcasing RHCP&rsquo;s orgasmic melody.</em></p>

<p>Mistake is something almost all sane humans cautiously avoid.
But some evade making mistakes faithfully to the point that they developed deep fear with it.
I, for one, is one of those few people, which I came to realize after some time spent staring blankly at our gloomy ceiling. I fear making mistakes, specifically those which can undoubtedly be credited to me. Then, I asked myself, <em>&ldquo;Is it wrong to have this fear?&rdquo;</em>. Just think about it for a moment, mistakes are plainly negative. And I hold my ground that there&rsquo;s no such thing as positive mistake. So it makes a whole lot of sense to avoid it, or even fear it. Why should you love something that is wrong?</p>

<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the other part of the equation. Let&rsquo;s talk about this villain called <em>Fear</em>, particularly fear of making mistakes, and its main weapon <em>nervousness</em>.
This fear hides calmly inside everyone of us, patiently waiting for the right time to unleash nervousness to its prey. And for those who can&rsquo;t tame this beast, just like me,
it will fuck your whole body system without any trace of mercy.
Fear-induced nervousness is unimaginably drastic that it will kill the core of your personality.
Communication, creativity, motor sensors, judgment, everything will be fucked up.
Basically, it is taking over your life for a couple of seconds, and fucking up with everything
you&rsquo;re trying to say, do, or think.</p>

<p>Unlike any other adults, for me, it is perplexing.
Making mistakes and the fear of of them are both negative.
Just what the fuck should I do.
How can I overcome this psychological terror?</p>

<p>So for the next few days before writing the following paragraphs, I&rsquo;ve spent enough time staring on those old ceiling again.
My eyes strolled each cobwebs as if the answers are trapped in them.
I gathered my sanity and logic to come up with a counter-attack, and of course, a reasonable ending for this mediocre article.
After almost reaching the brink of madness, I believe &mdash;&ndash; I wanted to believe that I came up with something.</p>

<p>I missed an important piece of this puzzle, and that is the fact that there are
2 types of mistake. One, is the nasty thing you do after hearing the devil&rsquo;s voice,
and the other is the side effect of some action after an angel&rsquo;s whisper.
And I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry for myself for fearing the latter.</p>

<p><em>Side effect of angel&rsquo;s &mdash;&ndash; what the fuck are you taking about!?</em></p>

<p>Well, those mistakes we make unintentionally from trying to leave our comfort zone.
From trying to learn something new. From trying to be better at something.
From trying to stand up for our principles.
From trying to be creative.
Can we all say that those are not that bad? Really, they are not that grave.
They will not fucking cost you your ticket to heaven.</p>

<p>If you give a second thought about it, maybe there&rsquo;s no serious reason to fear that kind of error.
Maybe it&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s way of telling you that you are almost at the next level of awesomeness.
Or maybe, it is a gentle reminder that, like the old cliche said, nobody is perfect.
It is a subtle note that reminds us that we, humans, are vulnerable.
That no matter how hard we think, no matter how hard we practice,
we will still find a way to fuck up everything.
Yes, even if we reach the highest level of a specific skill, we will still make blunders from time to time,
or there will still be a 10 year old Asian kid that will be better than us.
So why worry for something that will happen eventually, no matter how hard you try to prevent it?
There&rsquo;s absolutely no reason!</p>

<p>Fuck it.</p>

<p>Fuck the sweaty palms!</p>
