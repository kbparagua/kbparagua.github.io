  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again, I stare at the chessboard.
I can see colored wooden men standing on black and white squares.
Everything is clear, but nothing makes any sense.
Fuck. Here it is again. My heart is pounding so hard. My hands are shaking.
What is happening? My mind is full of shit.</p>

<p>With full of conviction, he moves his piece.</p>

<p>Just what the fuck is that?!
What should I do? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I don&rsquo;t know!</p>

<p>I move my piece somewhere. I have no idea. Then instantly, he responds.
As if he already knows what&rsquo;s going to happen next.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Checkmate!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Ww&mdash;&ndash; what?!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Before the helpless me even grasps the brutality of the situation, the game ends.
In a snap of a finger, the shaking and pounding is gone.
The gears inside my head starts working again, and then, everything in front of me becomes vivid and obvious.
I see, the black king is helplessly cornered by a single ambitious pawn and of course his powerful racist queen.
What happened? I have no fucking idea. But I know something was wrong during that terrible battle.
It&rsquo;s like that I&rsquo;m not the one who played that game.
All I can recall is my first move, and after that, it seems like someone or something took over the driver&rsquo;s seat for me.
Fuck that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to get straight right away; <strong>The spotlight of physical fitness is your body&rsquo;s health</strong>.
It is not about protein shakes and supplements, neither about <em>P90X</em> nor <em>Crossfit</em>, neither about <em>TRX</em> nor the latest Ab machine. It is about you.</p>

<p>Observing the fitness industry today, I assume that we are losing our focus. Little did we know, we are falling on these clever marketing stunts. Numerous companies are letting us feel that achieving greater fitness is impossible without their product. They also go to the extent that they are proudly announcing that they are revolutionizing the fitness world. So-called <em>&ldquo;Scientific studies&rdquo;</em> are also used to make the stunts more effective. And even worse, the one thing that I hate the most, there are specific organizations that impose themselves as the <strong>enlightened ones</strong>, the <strong>elites</strong>, the <strong>we-are-the-real-meaning-of-fitness</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I&rsquo;m paying 10 dollars a year for this blog, and since my brain is beginning to itch with stuff in between shitty and witty, I&rsquo;m obliged to write a fucking article again. Yes, I said <em>fucking</em> without any reason. Deal with it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an ambitious procrastinator. Well, I guess most of us are. <strong>Dream big. Do small.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve many things to do &mdash; suppose to do. But most of my time is spent thinking and stressing about how little time I have to do all those things. You can very well relate I know. We have many things to do. Almost 9 hours in the office, not counting the travel and shitty unnecessary surprise overtimes yet. Then, stupid scientists recommend 8 hours of sleep a day. 8 fucking hours doing nothing! Also, we need to allocate time for eating, peeing, pooping, walking, bathing, house cleaning, and other necessary things ending in <em>ing</em>. I guess an average person is spending at least 19 hours a day to do all his obligations. Then using my cutting edge algebra skills acquired from grade 5, I say that we are only left with 5 hours worth of free time. Not including weekends.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The time has come again to ask myself these disturbing questions:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;So how did you spent your life this year? Anything new? Anything changed? Where are you now?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I just celebrated either the 23rd year of my mere existence or 23rd year of me living my life. I&rsquo;m still not sure which of the two. Whatever. I&rsquo;ll find out next year. Hopefully. But one thing is for sure, this is the time to stand in front of the mirror and rediscover myself.</p>

<p><em>So, what did you discover looking at your past self? Any lessons for your future self?</em></p>

<p>Okay. I have some minor lessons like <em>Time is Gold</em> or <em>Take a bath everyday</em>, but I&rsquo;ll talk to you about that in another time. For now, here are the 4 major lessons I want you to keep in mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a terrible secret; I sucked at socialization. And I sucked at grammar. <em>Is it really right that I used semicolon there? Is it okay that I started a sentence with an &lsquo;And&rsquo;?</em></p>

<p>Yes, I can talk and hangout with people. But when he/she says or do something bullshit, well fuck, it will be over. That will be the final friendly activity the two of us will have. All remaining encounters will be small hi-hello conversations. I&rsquo;m just so allergic to bullshits, attention whores, know-it-all guys, and all those fucking annoying people I encounter everyday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s almost a year and a half since I started working. Since I started building the foundation of my career. Maybe it&rsquo;s too early, but I just learned a major lesson in life.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to brag too much about myself (F*ck it. This is my blog), but I can confidently say that I&rsquo;m a skilled programmer. During college, I programmed a Lexer Generator for our mini compiler project and my professor thought that I just downloaded it. I don&rsquo;t know if the University expects less from students or if what I did is really unbelievable. Once, I got 150/100 score because I taught one of my professor a nifty technique to convert a number string to an integer object. I also have a short debate with another professor about Polymorphism, and made him doubt his knowledge in the said topic. I got exempted from a quiz because I&rsquo;m the only one who answered a challenge question given by a professor &mdash; <em>&ldquo;What is the difference between functional programming and object-oriented programming? And why is there a need for OOP?&rdquo;</em>. I explained to the whole class about the heap and stack, what triggers stack overflow error, how OOP helps prevent stack overflow, how an object is instantiated and other sh*ts. <strong>I&rsquo;m not a cum laude or whatever, I just know my sh*ts</strong>. Well, those are some of the highlights of my pre-work life. Sorry I bragged too much. I didn&rsquo;t mean to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>&ldquo;Everyday, I make sure that I find time to hate people. It&rsquo;s good. It makes me think more about mysteries of life. ohhhh. f</em>ck you!&rdquo;*</p>

<p>A few days ago, my alter ego made that bold tweet. I was confused by that statement, so me and my alter ego had a talk about that sudden brain fart. The conclusion was startling. Nah, enough with the alter ego conspiracy just to sound like this post is something psychological. I just tweeted that because I realized that there is no single day in my life that I haven&rsquo;t killed someone in my mind. Yet I feel so good about it. So I&rsquo;ve reflected.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;There is something wrong with the site&rdquo; &mdash;&ndash; How the f*ck will I know what&rsquo;s wrong?! Can you just tell me what&rsquo;s the error!?&ldquo;</strong></p>
